How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I’ve learned that understanding user needs really means putting myself in their shoes. It’s not always about what they say they want, but more about what problem they’re trying to solve. Creating user stories helps a lot with that because it gives me a simple way to focus on what the user actually does and why. When I write them out, I can see things from their point of view, which makes it easier to design features that actually make sense for them.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I start developing a program, I try to take things step by step and not get too far ahead of myself. Breaking the project into smaller parts helps me stay focused and see progress faster. I really like how Agile does that too — it’s all about teamwork, adapting to changes, and improving as you go. I plan to use things like sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives in the future. Those help keep everyone on the same page and give the team a chance to talk about what’s working and what’s not.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means more than just doing your part of the work. It’s about being dependable, communicating well, and helping others when they need it. I’ve realized that even small things like checking in with teammates or being honest when you’re stuck can make a big difference. In software development, the best results come when everyone’s working together toward the same goal and not just focusing on their own tasks.
