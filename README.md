# CS-250-Software-Development-Lifecycle
This repo contains my work from CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle at SNHU. It includes projects and assignments focused on Agile and Scrum, user stories, sprint planning, and retrospectives. The final project shows how I applied Agile methods in a simulated development team.
